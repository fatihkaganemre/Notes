The Notes website is help you to add notes and remove them.
It uses:
- PostgreSQL for data persistency
- HTML, CSS, React for frontend
- NodeJS for backend

How to run the app: 
>FrontEnd
- npm install
- npm start

>Backend
- npm install
- node server.js || nodemon server.js

P.S: The backend runs on Port: 3001 and front-end runs on Port:3000
I use proxy in Frontend/package.json for connection between backend and frontend
